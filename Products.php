	<h2>New Nile Papadam</h2><br>
	<p>A papadum (also called papad) is a thin, crisp, round flatbread from the Indian subcontinent. It is typically based on a seasoned dough usually made from peeled black gram flour (urad flour), either fried or cooked with dry heat (usually flipping it over an open flame). Flours made from other sources such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca, certain millets or potato can be used.</p>

	<p>Papadums are typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka or as an appetizer or snack, sometimes with 
	toppings such as chopped onions, chopped carrots, chutneys or other dips, and condiments. In Pakistan, these are made of rice and often used as a snack or meal 
	accompaniment. In certain parts of India, papadums which have been dried, but not cooked, are used in curries and vegetable dishes. Papadums have been a part of
	the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent for generations and are an intrinsic part of everyday meals.</p>
